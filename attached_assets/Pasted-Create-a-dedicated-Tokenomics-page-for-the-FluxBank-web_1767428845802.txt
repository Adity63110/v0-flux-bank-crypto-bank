Create a dedicated “Tokenomics” page for the FluxBank website, accessible only via the navbar.

This page must clearly explain Flux’s economic flywheel, where creator fees are recycled into buybacks and user rewards, creating continuous value flow.

Navigation & Access

• Navbar item: Tokenomics
• Opens as a full page or slide-in panel
• Smooth, premium transition animation
• Dark-mode first UI with Flux green accents (#54d292)

Page Intent

Communicate that Flux is not just a token, but an economic engine where:
• Platform activity generates fees
• Fees fund buybacks
• Buybacks reward users
• Rewards increase usage
• Usage increases fees again

A self-reinforcing system.

Layout Structure

Use a two-column responsive layout with interactive cards and animated diagrams.

LEFT COLUMN – FLUX UTILITY & VALUE CAPTURE
Heading

Flux Tokenomics

Subheading
The Engine Behind Borrowing, Staking, and Rewards

Intro Text

Flux powers the entire FluxBank ecosystem. Every borrow, stake, and interaction contributes to a value loop that benefits active users.

Utility Cards (Interactive)

1. Borrowing Collateral
• Flux can be used as collateral to borrow multiple cryptocurrencies
• Higher Flux holdings unlock better borrow limits

2. Staking & Yield
• Stake Flux to earn protocol rewards
• Rewards scale with platform usage

3. Fee Recycling (Flywheel Core)
• Creator fees collected from borrowing and staking
• Fees are partially used for Flux buybacks
• Bought-back Flux is redistributed to users

4. Governance (Future)
• Flux holders influence protocol decisions
• Voting power scales with stake and participation

Each card should animate on hover or click.

RIGHT COLUMN – TOKEN ECONOMICS & DISTRIBUTION
Token Supply Overview

Display stat cards for:
• Total Supply
• Circulating Supply
• Staked Supply
• Locked / Vesting Supply

Distribution Chart

• Interactive pie or donut chart
• Hover tooltips with clear explanations
• Allocation categories:
– Community & Rewards
– Ecosystem Growth
– Team & Advisors
– Treasury
– Liquidity

🔁 FEE BUYBACK FLYWHEEL (CORE FEATURE)

Create a central animated flywheel diagram showing this loop:

1. User Activity
Borrowing, staking, and protocol usage generate creator fees

2. Creator Fee Collection
Fees accumulate in the FluxBank treasury

3. Automated Buybacks
A portion of fees is used to buy Flux from the open market

4. User Rewards
Bought-back Flux is:
• Distributed to stakers
• Used as incentives
• Potentially burned or locked (optional future mechanic)

5. Increased Participation
Rewards encourage more usage, restarting the cycle

The flywheel should rotate or animate subtly on scroll.

USER BENEFIT HIGHLIGHTS (CALLOUT SECTION)

Add a horizontal highlight section:

• “Fees work for users, not against them”
• “Platform growth directly benefits Flux holders”
• “Sustainable rewards backed by real activity”

TRANSPARENCY & TRUST

Include a clear note:

“Creator fees are transparently tracked and used to strengthen the Flux ecosystem through buybacks and rewards.”

UX & DESIGN RULES

• Smooth left/right scroll-in animations
• Interactive diagrams with tooltips
• Minimal hype, maximum clarity
• Mobile-friendly
• Professional fintech aesthetic

VISUAL STYLE

• Dark background
• Subtle gradients
• Flux green highlights (#54d292)
• Clean typography
• No meme visuals

FINAL GOAL

The Tokenomics page should make it obvious that:
• Flux captures real value
• Fees create buy pressure
• Users are rewarded automatically
• The system improves as it grows

This page should feel comparable to top-tier DeFi protocols, not experimental projects.
