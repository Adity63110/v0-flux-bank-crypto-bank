Design a premium homepage credibility section for a modern crypto neo-bank called FluxBank.

The section should be visually striking, trustworthy, and futuristic, similar to high-end fintech products like Revolut, Stripe, and modern Web3 banks.

Layout

Use a two-column responsive layout:

Left Column – Interactive Bank Stats Card

• Display a sleek digital bank-style statistics card
• Glassmorphism design with soft blur, rounded corners, and subtle neon glow using color code #54d292
• Include a minimal bank or user icon
• Show the metric:
“Total Accounts Registered”
• Large animated number that counts up smoothly on page load (example: 12,483+)
• Hover animation that increases glow, depth, and shadow
• Card should feel like a real banking dashboard widget
• Optimized for desktop and mobile
• Designed to connect to live backend data later

Right Column – Detailed FAQ Accordion

Create a clean accordion-style FAQ column with smooth expand/collapse animations.
Only one question should be open at a time.
Active questions should have a subtle Flux green highlight.
