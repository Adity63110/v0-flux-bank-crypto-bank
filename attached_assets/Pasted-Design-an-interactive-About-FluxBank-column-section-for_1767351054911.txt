Design an interactive “About FluxBank” column/section for the FluxBank homepage that explains the platform in a modern, engaging, and trust-focused way.

The section should feel like a story + product explainer, not a static wall of text, and match FluxBank’s premium fintech + Web3 aesthetic using the accent color #54d292.

Layout

Use a two-column responsive layout:

Left Column – About FluxBank (Interactive)

• Large heading:
“About FluxBank”
• Subheading:
A New Kind of Crypto Bank
• Short intro paragraph explaining FluxBank’s mission:

FluxBank is a next-generation crypto bank that lets users unlock liquidity without selling their assets. By using Flux as collateral, users can borrow across major blockchains while keeping full visibility and control.

• Below the intro, display interactive info blocks or tabs (clickable or hover-activated):

Interactive Blocks:

1. Why FluxBank
• Borrow without selling
• Transparent, price-aware limits
• Built like a real bank, powered by crypto

2. How It Works
• Sign up and receive an instant wallet
• Deposit Flux as collateral
• Borrow supported assets based on real-time prices
• Requests are recorded and processed securely

3. What Makes It Different
• Bank-style UX instead of complex DeFi dashboards
• Unified transaction history
• Manual + automated safety checks

Each block should animate smoothly when selected, with a subtle glow or underline effect.

Right Column – Visual / Motion Element

• Animated illustration or visual container
• Central Flux logo with a soft neon glow
• Surrounding icons representing supported blockchains and assets
• Light floating or pulse animations to convey activity and liquidity
• Glassmorphism panel or gradient background for depth

UX & Interaction Requirements

• Smooth transitions between info blocks
• Clear active state indicators
• Keyboard and mobile friendly
• Subtle hover glow using Flux green
• Clean spacing for readability

Visual Style

• Futuristic, minimal, premium fintech
• Dark-mode first
• Soft gradients and glow, never harsh
• Inspired by modern neobanks and Web3 platforms

Purpose

This section should:
• Explain FluxBank in under 30 seconds
• Build trust and clarity
• Reduce confusion for first-time users
• Feel interactive and alive, not static
