Create a hidden “Future Ambitions” section for the FluxBank website that is accessible only via the navbar (not visible on scroll by default).

This section should feel exclusive, visionary, and forward-looking, similar to a product roadmap reveal from a major fintech or crypto wallet.

Navigation Behavior

• Add a navbar item called “Future” or “Vision”
• Clicking it opens a dedicated full-width panel or page
• Smooth slide-in or fade-in transition
• Dark-mode focused with Flux green accents (#54d292)

Section Purpose

Showcase FluxBank’s long-term ambitions and upcoming products, focusing on mobile app and browser extension, with a unique twist around loans and staking.

Layout

Use a two-column interactive layout:

Left Column – Vision & Ambitions (Interactive)

Heading:
The Future of FluxBank

Subheading:
Banking, Borrowing, and Staking — Everywhere

Short intro text:

FluxBank is expanding beyond the web. Our goal is to bring lending and staking directly into everyday crypto workflows, without friction.

Below the intro, add interactive vision blocks or tabs:

1. FluxBank Mobile App
• iOS & Android native apps
• Borrow and stake directly from your phone
• Real-time loan tracking and approvals
• Push notifications for price changes and borrow limits

2. FluxBank Browser Extension
• Works like major crypto wallets
• Built-in borrowing and staking layer
• Borrow liquidity without leaving a website
• Seamless interaction with dApps

3. The Flux Twist
• Loans + staking integrated at the wallet level
• No need to sell assets to access liquidity
• Banking-grade UX with Web3 power

Each block should animate smoothly when selected, with glowing active states and subtle motion.

Right Column – Interactive Product Previews

• Animated mockups or interface previews
• One preview for mobile app UI
• One preview for browser extension UI
• Screens should show:
– Loan dashboard
– Staking panel
– Available balance and borrow limits

• Use floating, parallax, or hover-based animations
• Subtle glow and glassmorphism panels
• Flux logo watermark or accent in previews

Interaction & Animation

• Smooth transitions between mobile and extension previews
• Light floating animations for screens
• Hover reveals UI details
• No autoplay distractions

UX & Tone

• Visionary but grounded
• Premium fintech aesthetic
• Clean typography
• Minimal but impressive
• Feels like a glimpse into the future, not a promise overload

Accessibility & Performance

• Responsive on all devices
• Reduced motion support
• Fast load despite animations

Goal

This section should:
• Build excitement and trust
• Signal long-term commitment
• Position FluxBank alongside major wallets and banks
• Make users feel early to something big

This section is intentionally hidden behind the navbar to feel exclusive and forward-looking.
