Implement the borrow functionality for the FluxBank web app with a dedicated borrowing page, dynamic price-based limits, and shared transaction history.

Navigation:

Add a hamburger menu (three lines) at the top-left of the app.

Menu items:

Dashboard (main page)

Borrow

Deposit

Stake

Clicking Borrow or the Borrow button on the dashboard should redirect to the same Borrow page.

Borrow Page Flow:

Step 1: Select Asset

Display a list/dropdown of supported cryptocurrencies.

Selecting a coin sets it as the borrowing asset.

Step 2: Enter Amount

Show:

User’s Flux token balance

Current USD price of Flux

Current USD price of the selected crypto

Calculate maximum borrowable amount dynamically:

Max Borrow = 30% of (Flux balance × Flux price) ÷ Selected crypto price

Display:

“Max you can borrow: X [crypto]”

Input field should:

Prevent values above the max

Update in real time using current crypto prices

Step 3: Submit Borrow Request

When user submits:

Do NOT send funds immediately

Record the borrow request as pending

Transaction Recording:

Add the borrow request to a Recent Transactions panel at the bottom of the Borrow page.

Also show the same Recent Transactions panel on the main dashboard.

Transactions must include:

Type: Deposit / Borrow

Asset

Amount

Status: Pending / Approved / Rejected

Timestamp

Database Tables:

transactions

id (uuid)

user_id (uuid)

type (deposit, borrow)

asset (text)

amount (numeric)

status (pending, approved, rejected)

created_at (timestamp)

Price Handling:

Fetch real-time prices from a crypto price API.

Cache prices briefly to avoid excessive requests.

Prices must be used only for calculation, not execution.

UX Requirements:

Step-based UI with progress indicator

Clear max borrow warning

Disabled submit button if amount exceeds limit

Smooth page transitions

Result:

Users can request crypto loans backed by Flux tokens

Borrow limits are transparent and price-aware

All actions appear in a unified transaction history

System is ready for future admin approval or automated loan execution
